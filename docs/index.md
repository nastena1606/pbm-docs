# Percona Backup for MongoDB Documentation


Percona Backup for MongoDB is an open-source, distributed and low-impact solution for consistent backups of [MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets](deployments.md). It enables you to make logical, physical, incremental and selective backups and restores. [Point-in-Time recovery](usage/point-in-time-recovery.md) functionality allows you to recover your database to a specific timestamp. 

With Percona Backup for MongoDB you can  design and implement the effective backup strategy that considers the size and usage patterns of your database, the resources it utilizes and the goals of your organization.

[^1]: Tech Preview Features are not yet ready for enterprise use and are not included in support via SLA. They are included in this release so that users can provide feedback prior to the full release of the feature in a future GA release (or removal of the feature if it is deemed not useful). This functionality can change (APIs, CLIs, etc.) from tech preview to GA.
