# Percona Backup for MongoDB Documentation


Percona Backup for MongoDB is an open-source, distributed and low-impact solution for consistent backups of [MongoDB sharded clusters and replica sets](deployments.md). 

It enables you to make logical, physical, incremental and selective backups and restores. [Point-in-Time recovery](usage/point-in-time-recovery.md) functionality allows you to recover your database to a specific timestamp.
